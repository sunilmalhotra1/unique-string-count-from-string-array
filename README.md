# Unique string count from string array
Find the unique strings count from a string array. Need to check is there any possibility to match strings with each other. If strings match it means strings are not unique.
1. Input like that {"abcd", "acbd", "adcb", "cdba", "bcda", "badc","sstvz","zvsst","wxvsl"}
2. Here in this input array by looking into these value we see there is possiblity that some the string can be same if we replace the position of some characters.
3. Same string can be like 1. "abcd", "acbd", "adcb", "cdba", "bcda", "badc", 
                           2. "sstvz","zvsst" 
                           3. "wxvsl"
5. So the unique string count is 3 in the given input.
